# Tentative game title
Welcome! This is my project to further showcase my skills using Bevy in Rust. This time, it will be a tad bit more complicated since it is dealing with a 3D environment, with camera movement and 3D models.
The main premise for this game is a fun little shooting game where you can expect enemies to move towards you like zombies and you can earn points by killing them! 
For those of you that are brave enough to play this game, you will get access to different projectiles that you can utilize to slay these monsters.
To keep things interesting, I won't disclose what those abilities do so as to not spoil your fun (please don't look at the code first :D).
Enjoy zombie slaying!

FYI: The models are not fully developed yet, so all you get are zombie cubes. Tadah.

## How to play
It is so easy with Rust. Just enter the command `cargo run` and you're good to go!
